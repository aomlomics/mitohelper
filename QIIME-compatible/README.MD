### QIIME-compatible marker gene reference databases
We provide pre-formatted, [QIIME-compatible](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/data-resources/) reference sequence and taxonomy files. 
12S rRNA gene sequences were processed using [RESCRIPt](https://github.com/bokulich-lab/RESCRIPt). 
The processing workflow is described [here](https://github.com/shenjean/mitohelper/wiki/8.-Creating-QIIME-compatible-reference-databases) in the getMito wiki.
